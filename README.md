### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I spent most of my career working as event manager and a tutor for teaching programming. I spent around last five years of my university mentoring high school students for Java programming language. I graduated college and worked for a year at a logistics startup that unfortunately shutdown due to pandemic lockdowns.

After being laid-off due to closure of the company, I worked at a local cyber-cafe as a technical assistant. I also started working as a freelancer. I mostly bid for projects that are around data science domain. I deliver end to end projects powered by AI. I now have around a decade experience in Python and SQL.

I used automated bidding algorithm created by me to pitch for projects and had bagged over 80 jobs by saving 60% of manual cold calling time.

In the meantime I did certifications around data analytics, data Visualization and Machine Learning from 2020-2021. I am always open to explore new countries and cultures. By 2022 I intend to work for a tech giant in Germany or France or the United Kingdom. Yes I do need work permit sponsor.

Want to hire me for product manager or program manager or data engineering or data analyst role?
